Objective: Recognize hand gestures in real-time and identify specific gestures.

Tools: MediaPipe for gesture recognition and OpenCV for video processing.

Process:

Capture video feed from the webcam.
Use MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and pose landmarks.

Output: A video feed with detected landmarks and recognized gestures.

Applications:
1. Healthcare Applications: Use gestures for patient interaction in medical devices or therapy sessions.
2. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR): Enhance VR/AR experiences with natural hand interactions.
3. Sign Language Interpretation: Develop systems to interpret sign language in real-time for communication.
