1. Objective: Recognize hand gestures in real-time and identify specific gestures.
2. Tools: MediaPipe for gesture recognition and OpenCV for video processing.
3. Process:
(i) Capture video feed from the webcam.
(ii) Use MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and pose landmarks.
(iii) Draw detected landmarks on the video feed.
(iv) Train a machine learning model to recognize specific gestures based on landmark positions.
(v) Use the trained model to predict gestures in real-time.
4. Output: A video feed with detected landmarks and recognized gestures.
5. Applications:
1. Healthcare Applications: Use gestures for patient interaction in medical devices or therapy sessions.
2. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR): Enhance VR/AR experiences with natural hand interactions.
3. Sign Language Interpretation: Develop systems to interpret sign language in real-time for communication.
