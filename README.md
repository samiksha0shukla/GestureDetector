1. Objective: Recognize hand gestures in real-time and identify specific gestures.
2. Tools: MediaPipe for gesture recognition and OpenCV for video processing.
   
4. Process:
(i) Capture video feed from the webcam.
(ii) Use MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and pose landmarks.
(iii) Draw detected landmarks on the video feed.
(iv) Train a machine learning model to recognize specific gestures based on landmark positions.
(v) Use the trained model to predict gestures in real-time.

6. Output: A video feed with detected landmarks and recognized gestures.
   
8. Applications:
(i)  Healthcare Applications: Use gestures for patient interaction in medical devices or therapy sessions.
(ii) Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR): Enhance VR/AR experiences with natural hand interactions.
(iii) Sign Language Interpretation: Develop systems to interpret sign language in real-time for communication.
